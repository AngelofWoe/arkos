Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Package: dbus-user-session
Description-md5: be4453093922af92deac14b4e8458a83
Description-en: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.
 .
 See the dbus package description for more information about D-Bus in general.

 This package is mainly meant for other packages to use, in order to build
 custom flavours.
 .
 If you wish to use this package to create a custom Linux kernel, then it
 is suggested that you investigate the package kernel-package, which has
 been designed to ease the task of creating kernel image packages.
 .
 If you are simply trying to build third-party modules for your kernel,
 you do not want this package. Install the appropriate linux-headers
 package instead.

 OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed by
 Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer imaging applications.
 .
 OpenEXR's features include:
    * Higher dynamic range and colour precision than existing 8- and
      10-bit image file formats.
    * Support for the "half" 16-bit floating-point pixel format.
    * Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the
      included codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on
      images with film grain.
    * Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily
      be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR
      software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors,
      integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without
      affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR
      applications.
