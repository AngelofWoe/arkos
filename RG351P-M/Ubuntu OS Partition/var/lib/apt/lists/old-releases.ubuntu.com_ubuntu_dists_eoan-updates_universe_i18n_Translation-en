Package: amphora-agent
Description-md5: 69dc8ed981d458e6684a63e3ef5be102
Description-en: OpenStack Load Balancer Service - Amphora agent
 Openstack Load Balancer as a Service, codenamed Octavia was borne
 out of the Neutron LBaaS project. Its conception influenced
 the transformation of the Neutron LBaaS project, as Neutron LBaaS
 moved from version 1 to version 2. Starting with the Liberty
 release of OpenStack, Octavia has become the reference implementation
 for Neutron LBaaS version 2.
 .
 Octavia accomplishes its delivery of load balancing services by
 managing a fleet of virtual machines, containers, or bare metal
 servers—collectively known as amphorae— which it spins up on demand.
 This on-demand, horizontal scaling feature differentiates Octavia from
 other load balancing solutions, thereby making Octavia truly
 suited “for the cloud.”.
 .
 This package provides Octavia Amphora Agent.

 .
 SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Redis are supported for the user
 repository (if authentication is required).
 The long-term credentials mechanism is supported.
 For WebRTC applications,
 the TURN server REST API for time-limited
 secret-based authentication is implemented.
 The third-party authentication
 specs (OAuth-based) are supported, too.
 .
 Load balancing can be implemented either by DNS round-robin mechanism, or with
 the external networking tools, or by
 the built-in ALTERNATE-SERVER mechanism.
 .
 The implementation is intended to be simple to install and configure.
 The project focuses on performance, scalability, and simplicity.

Package: ctdb
Description-md5: 83dff66615250b53a0cd3df6fb3b9ea7
Description-en: clustered database to store temporary data
 CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other
 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for
 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware
 and use CTDB instead.
 .
 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,
 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.
 .
 Features include:
  * CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across
    all nodes in a cluster.
  * CTDB is very fast.
  * In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB
    databases that it manages.
  * CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with
    Samba3/4.
  * CTDB provides HA features such as node monitoring, node failover, and IP
    takeover.
  * CTDB provides a reliable messaging transport to allow applications linked
    with CTDB to communicate to other instances of the application running on
    different nodes in the cluster.
  * CTDB has pluggable transport backends. Currently implemented backends are
    TCP and Infiniband.
  * CTDB supports a system of application specific management scripts, allowing
    applications that depend on network or filesystem resources to be managed in
    a highly available manner on a cluster.

Package: dh-modaliases
Description-md5: 1a811f1261ebf8d94f48be93de246b96
Description-en: debhelper extension for scanning kernel module aliases
 dh_modaliases is useful for packages that ship third-party kernel modules,
 either in binary form, or as sources (with e. g. DKMS). It extracts the
 modules' modaliases from either the compile .ko files themselves (for packages
 which ship them in compiled form, using modinfo), or from a package file
 debian/packagename.modaliases.
 .
 This enables software which is looking for missing driver packages (such as
 Jockey or the operating system installer) to identify which package(s) will
 provide a driver for a piece of hardware, identified by its modalias.

Package: git-all
Description-md5: 7eb276543374432338c2d9bf7a76e9b6
Description-en: fast, scalable, distributed revision control system (all subpackages)
 Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large
 projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile
 open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.
 .
 Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
 central server.

 .
 Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a

 .
 This package provides the git cvsimport, cvsexportcommit, and cvsserver
 tools, which allow Git to read from and write to CVS repositories and
 offer access over CVS protocol to Git repositories.
 .
 The git cvsimport tool can incrementally import from a repository that
 is being actively developed and only requires remote access over CVS
 protocol. Unfortunately, in many situations the import leads to
 incorrect results. For reliable, one-shot imports, cvs2git from the
 cvs2svn package or parsecvs may be a better fit.

 git-daemon, as provided by the git package, is a simple server for git
 repositories, ideally suited for read-only updates, i.e. pulling from git
 repositories through the network.  This package provides a runit service
 for running git-daemon permanently.  This configuration is simpler and
 more reliable than git-daemon-sysvinit, at a cost of being less
 familiar for administrators accustomed to sysvinit.

 The key parts of GNOME Flashback are the GNOME Panel and the Metacity
 window manager. All other components, such as the file manager, the
 settings center, and the various applications, come from mainstream
 GNOME.
 .
 GNOME Flashback has lower hardware requirements than GNOME Shell, and
 consumes less memory.

 Software lets you install and update applications and system extensions.
 .
 Software uses a plugin architecture to separate the frontend from the
 technologies that are used underneath. Currently, a PackageKit plugin provides
 data from a number of traditional packaging systems, such as rpm or apt. An
 appdata plugin provides additional metadata from locally installed data in the
 appdata format.

 Security (TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3) and Datagram
 Transport Layer Security (DTLS 1.0, 1.2) protocols.
 .
 GnuTLS features support for:
  - certificate path validation, as well as DANE and trust on first use.
  - the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).
  - public key methods, including RSA and Elliptic curves, as well as password
    and key authentication methods such as SRP and PSK protocols.
  - all the strong encryption algorithms, including AES and Camellia.
  - CPU-assisted cryptography with VIA padlock and AES-NI instruction sets.
  - HSMs and cryptographic tokens, via PKCS #11.
 .
 This package contains a commandline interface to the GNU TLS library, which
 can be used to set up secure connections from e.g. shell scripts, debugging
 connection issues or managing certificates.
 .
 Useful utilities include:
  - TLS termination: gnutls-cli, gnutls-serv
  - key and certificate management: certtool, ocsptool, p11tool
  - credential management: srptool, psktool

 release of OpenStack, Octavia has become the reference implementation
 for Neutron LBaaS version 2.

 Octavia accomplishes its delivery of load balancing services by
 managing a fleet of virtual machines, containers, or bare metal
 servers—collectively known as amphorae— which it spins up on demand.
 This on-demand, horizontal scaling feature differentiates Octavia from
 other load balancing solutions, thereby making Octavia truly

 state-of-the-art cryptography (the "Noise" protocol). It aims to be
 faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPSec, while avoiding
 the massive headache. It intends to be considerably more performant
 than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for
 running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for
 many different circumstances. It runs over UDP.
 .
 This package uses DKMS to automatically build the wireguard kernel
 module.
